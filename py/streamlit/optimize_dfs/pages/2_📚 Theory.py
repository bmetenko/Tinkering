    # Pandas Optimization Theory
    
    Pandas is a powerful tool for data analysis, but it can be slow and memory-intensive when dealing with large datasets. There are several ways to optimize pandas to improve its performance, including:
    
    - Dropping unnecessary columns
    - Using appropriate data types
    - Vectorizing operations
    - Using in-place operations
    - And more!
